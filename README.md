# Multidimensional Scaling for the 3d visualization of the dynamical propagation of correlations in stock's closing prices

The approach taken will make use of two python scripts `corrMDS.py` and `stock_data_collection_tools.py`. The first program contains the class and its methods for transforming a dataframe of time series objects into a 3d trajectory. The second one is a collection of functions necessary for retrieving and processing closing prices for the german DAX index and has been adopted almost one to one from Kinsleys's Youtube Playlist on [Python Programming for Finance](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcOdF96TBtRtuQksErCEBYZ).

In the following, I will discuss the motivation and the problem of transforming the correlation structure of time series, specifically stock prices, into a configuration of points in an abstract 3d cartesian space for a holistic visualization approach of the statistical relationship between them. I will make a few remarks on the package dependencies and I will link their respective documentation pages afterwards. A user guide is added, explaining the procedure by applying multidimensional scaling to the correlation structure of daily stock closing prices for the german DAX index for the past 10 years. I will conclude with an API reference, giving an overiew of the class and its methods.

## Introduction

### Correlation matrices

Although quite easy to compute, the inference of information from correlation matrices can get messy, once we want to get a birds eye view on the correlation structure as a whole and are not only interested in pairwise dependencies. While it might be possible to get an overall feeling for the correlations of a few time series, it gets increasingly more difficult for larger collections as the number of pairwise correlations for $`n`$ time series grows as $`\mathscr(O)(n^2)`$. A typicall correlation matrix is shown in the following graphic for some stocks of the german DAX index.
